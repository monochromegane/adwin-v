ADWIN-V is an adaptive windowing algorithm for vector data.
It detects a change point using the vector magnitude and cosine similarity between mean vector and the vector.
The change detection algorithm is ADWIN or ADWIN2 which is from `Learning from time-changing data with adaptive windowing, Bifet, Albert, and Ricard Gavalda; Proceedings of the 2007 SIAM international conference on data mining. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2007`.
